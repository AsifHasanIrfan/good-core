              We offer fixed-scope fixed-price projects, flexible time &
              materials (T&M) options, or a dedicated team on a monthly
              retainer, as well as any combination of the three. Regardless of
              the model, we stick to industry best practices in delivery,
              project management, and talent retention, which has enabled us to
              take up ambitious software development projects and deliver them
              successfully.
