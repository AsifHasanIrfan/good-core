              Our process of app development followed the agile model that began
              with acquiring the necessary knowledge about our clientâ€™s customer
              base and their operational requirements. After extensive
              brainstorming sessions with our client, we finalised the
              conceptual and visual design on the software and kickstarted the
              development process.
              <br />
              <br />
              We built a highly-interactive frontend using JQuery and Bootstrap
              and used the PHP Yii framework to implement the MVC architecture
              of the briefing management software. Our focus was to ensure a
              highly-secured application architecture, design, and code
              implementation.

              To guarantee the best performance and quality, the product
              underwent a rigorous testing process before and after the launch
              that included white-box black-box, and post-launch testing. We
              also provided support and necessary enhancements following the
              launch.
